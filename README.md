#Netflix Clone – Frontend Website
🔗[ Live Demo](https://netflixclonersr.ccbp.tech/)

Built as part of a frontend development competition conducted by Outlier, this Netflix-inspired clone replicates the look and feel of the popular streaming platform using only frontend technologies. The project focuses on clean UI design, responsive layout, and visually structured content sections to mimic a real-world streaming experience.

Key Features:

🧑‍💻 Role: Solo frontend developer for competition submission

🌐 Frontend-Only Implementation: Developed entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no backend/API integration

🎬 Netflix-Like UI: Designed to resemble the original Netflix homepage with banners, category carousels, and featured sections

📱 Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop

🎨 Modern Styling: Dark-themed aesthetic with hover effects, smooth layout, and clean typography

🚀 Deployed via CCBP Hosting: Instant access with fast and smooth performance

This project highlights my ability to recreate complex real-world interfaces using only frontend tools, with a strong focus on design fidelity and responsiveness.
